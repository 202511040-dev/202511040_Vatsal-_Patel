This repository contains the lab assignment on text vectorization and review classification using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Objective
To represent e-commerce review text numerically and apply machine learning and neural network models for:
- Multiclass product category classification
- Binary fake (CG) vs genuine (OR) review detection

## Dataset
E-commerce review dataset with product categories and review authenticity labels (CG / OR).

## Methods Used
- NLTK for text preprocessing
- Keras (Neural Networks) for classification
- Word Cloud for fake review analysis
